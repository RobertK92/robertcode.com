                    </header>
                    <p>This project aims to simulate the behaviour of a crowd at an airport. Visitors have certain utility curves that describe a desire to do an action over a variable (e.g. time). The planner will then construct a path of preconditions that will eventually lead to the completion of the agents goal. Actions are things like: go to the toilet, buy food/drink, check in, go through customs, board plane, etc.</p>

                        <h2>Goal Oriented Action Planner (GOAP)</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>While we were planning the technical design for this project, we initially wanted to use behaviour trees. However, we discovered that a GOAP will be much more flexible for quickly adding new tasks for the agents. a GOAP is also much easier to manage if the amount of tasks grow, because a task can simply be added to the system without the need of changing the structure of a behaviour tree since the tree will be created dynamically.</p>

                    <p>The structure is designed as follows:
                    There are Agents, All agents have their own Planner which determines the agents current Action.
                    Actions have Preconditions which are also actions. (e.g. a precondition for boarding the plane would be checking in and going through customs).</p>

                    <p>In the code below you can see that boarding the plane requires certain other actions: (!HasBoardedPlane, HasCheckedIn and HasSecurityCheck).</p>
                    
<pre><code>public class BoardPlaneAction : GoapAction
{
    public override int Cost { get { return 10; } }
    public override float Duration { get { return 20f; } }

    private GoapGoal[] _preconditions = new GoapGoal[]
    {
    state => !state.HasBoardedPlane,

    state => state.HasCheckedIn,
    state => state.HasSecurityCheck,
    };

    public override GoapGoal[] Preconditions { get { return _preconditions; } }

    public override bool Init(GoapAgent agent)
    {
        if (IsInitialized) return true;

        var flight = GetComponent&lt;Agent&gt;().flight;
        _target = Airport.Instance.GetGate(flight);

        if (_target == null)
            return false;

        IsInitialized = true;
        _currentDuration = Duration;

        return true;
    }

    public override void ChangeState(GoapState state)
    {
        state.HasBoardedPlane = true;
    }

    public override void NotifyAirport()
    {
        Airport.Instance.Register(_target, GetComponent&lt;Agent&gt;());
    }

    public override void Reset()
    {
        _currentDuration = 0f;
        IsInitialized = false;
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>The actions need to be created once and can then automatically be used by the planner. This is especially nice because the actions don&rsquo;t have any intertwined relationship with eachother (like behaviour trees do).</p>

<p>Available actions:</p>

<p><img src="../img/ai/goapActions.png" alt="Image_ActionScriptList" /></p>
                    
<h2 id="utility-theory">Utility Theory</h2>

<p>Utility Theory is basically a concept that determines how important an action is for a particular agent at a certain time.
So Utility Theory determines what action needs to be done, while the GOAP determines how that action can be done.</p>

<p>The image below shows the utility of a random agent.</p>

<p><img src="../img/ai/utility1.png" alt="Image_UtilityAgent" /></p>

<p>This agent has 5 different utilities (trail-actions that it can find important). With a trail-action I mean a pre-determined &ldquo;goal&rdquo; that can have preconditions but is essentially an end-goal instead of a substep. (e.g. the agents wants to board the plane, checking-in and going through customs is not what he wants, it something he has to do to reach the goal).</p>

<pre><code>public enum LongTermGoal
{
    None,
    Eat,
    Drink,
    Toilet,
    TakeCover,
    BoardPlane,
}</code></pre>

<p>The Utility Agent will notify the Goap Agent when a new goal has been assigned, the planner can then re-calculate the plan.</p>

<pre><code>private void OnLongTermGoalHasChanged(LongTermGoal goal)
{
    switch (goal)
    {
        case LongTermGoal.None:
            goapAgent.AssignGoals(null, LongTermGoal.None);
            navAgent.SetDestination(transform.position);
            break;
        case LongTermGoal.Eat:
            goapAgent.State.HasEaten = false;
            goapAgent.AssignGoals(new GoapGoal[]
            {
                state => state.HasEaten
            }, goal);
            break;
        case LongTermGoal.Drink:
            goapAgent.State.HasDrunk = false;
            goapAgent.AssignGoals(new GoapGoal[]
            {
                state => state.HasDrunk
            }, goal);
            break;
        case LongTermGoal.Toilet:
            goapAgent.State.HasUsedToilet = false;
            goapAgent.AssignGoals(new GoapGoal[]
            {
                state => state.HasUsedToilet
            }, goal);
            break;
        case LongTermGoal.TakeCover:
            break;
        case LongTermGoal.BoardPlane:
            goapAgent.State.HasBoardedPlane = false;
            goapAgent.AssignGoals(new GoapGoal[]
            {
                state => state.HasBoardedPlane
            }, goal);
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>The amount of &ldquo;Utility&rdquo; is determined per goal using a curve.
The curve represents how important (how much utility) the goal has over a value between 0 and 1. This value can differ per action . (e.g. For the boarding plane action (curve shown below), the value represents the current time devided by the departure time).</p>

<p><img src="../img/ai/boardplaneCurve.png" alt="Image_BoardplaneCurve" /></p>

<p>As you can see, boarding the plane is a very unimportant action when it&rsquo;s too early to board. But at a certain time (x amount of minutes before departure) it becomes important very quickly. At a certain time before departures it becomes 1.</p>

<p>The curve below shows the utility curve for the toilet action.</p>

<p><img src="../img/ai/wcCurve.png" alt="Image_WcCurve" /></p>

<p>This curve is different because you initially need to go a little bit and then your need increases more steadily over time.</p>

<p>I have build in a priority system on top of the utility system so that certain actions will always be chosen over others if their utility value is equal (you don&rsquo;t want to mis your plane because you have to go to the toilet).</p>
